# Deep-Learning
**Multivariate Time Series Analysis**
**Water Quality Forecasting **
This test is to understand your hands on data science skills in detail. The test consists of the 
following tasks – 
1. Develop a machine learning / deep learning model for the given problem statement and the 
dataset. 
2. Create a presentation to walk us through the details of all the steps you took and also the 
choices you made. 
Note: - Please note that the goal of this test is to understand your approach. The performance of the 
model itself is not important and is not something we will judge you on. So, if there are some things 
which could improve the model performance but may take a long time to do, you can just list them 
down in the presentation as ‘things to try’ along with the reasoning why you think they would help 
improve the model. 
**Use Case: **
To forecast the water quality parameters based on the historical data available. 
The forecasted value of one water quality parameter should take into consideration the effect of all 
the other parameters as well (Multivariate forecasting problem). 
For example: One of the columns in the dataset is Turbidity. So, the model should take into account 
the historical data of the column Turbidity along with the remaining columns in the dataset to 
forecast future values of Turbidity
